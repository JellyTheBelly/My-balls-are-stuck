    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes I wonder if games are the distraction from inevitable 
        death that is approaching towards every single human being on earth
        in order to not feel the void of despair upon knowing everyone shall suffer the same fate 
        without prior reasoning other than life. Every accomplishment we have done in our lives mean little
        to none from the fact that without any major, world changing achievement, it's barely of
        any use to other human beings. Some people enjoy looking at their ceiling thinking about nothing,
        which I think is where a human achieves true meaning of life, which is nothing. Some
        say it's the experience, some say it's the ammount of help you did to people. I think
        life is simply just a road where the humans are able to choose the path they're going to have in the after life.
        The very fact that everything dies brings dread to my existential existence, it happens way too much
        to where the very action of taking a piss will make me think why are we still here in the first place.
        What have we done before to deserve this, or perhaps it's what we are going to do is what makes us deserve the impending doom
        that is the never ending approach of death.
